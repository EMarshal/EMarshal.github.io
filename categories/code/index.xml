      <description>I was recently working on an MVVM project where various validation attributes were being set on the data model, and was looking for a solution to bind WPF editor control properties to these validation restrictions. (e.g. Setting TextBox.MaxLength based on StringLengthAttribute.)
Combining a couple of Stack Overflow posts:
 How to add a Blend Behavior in a Style Setter WPF TextBox MaxLength â€” Is there any way to bind this to the Data Validation Max Length on the bound field?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want your .NET property validation attributes to match the exact minimum and maximum values for your SQL decimal and numeric data types, you can do so with a validation attribute that you can apply to properties with &lt;code&gt;[SQLLimitedRangeAttribute](p, s)&lt;/code&gt;, where p and s are the precision and scale for the data type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Decided to add favicons and touch icons to the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve got no design skills, so used Jdenticon to generate icons based on my name. RealFaviconGenerator will automatically generate favicons with comprehensive browser and OS support, but I only really care about up to date browsers and operating systems, so I used their FAQ to piece together the requirements for that.
I used Jdenticon to generated large (3200x3200) icon. Then using GIMP, I autocropped edges and scaled to required various sizes as detailed below, each from fullsize and exported as PNG or ICO.</description>
