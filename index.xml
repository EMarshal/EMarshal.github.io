      <description>I recently went microwave shopping, starting with The Sweethome&amp;rsquo;s The Best Microwave guide. GE, in their wisdom, doesn&amp;rsquo;t sell any of the reviewed models in Canada, making comparison shopping impossible. Not only that, but of the seven countertop microwaves GE sells in Canada, every single one of them is 1.1 ft³, with no comparable models to the 1.6 and 0.7 ft³ picks from The Sweethome. These range from a 1.1 ft³ 1000 W model for $107 to an 1.</description>

      <description>Having recently acquired a New Nindendo 3DS XL (what kind of name is that?) system to keep my occupied on some upcoming plane trips, I&amp;rsquo;ve got several thoughts, unbiased by any prior portable console ownership.
Hardware Build Quality: All plastic. Certainly not premium, but solid.
Charger: Non-standard Nintendo plug, system does not include AC adapter. Charger output is 4.6 V, 900 mA. Should have simply been micro-USB. Any future iteration should be USB-C.</description>

      <description>A comparison of the Geekbench performance of mobile devices compared to their cost. Have tried to normalize price by preferentially choosing 32GB, then 64GB, then 16GB models, depending on availability. I&amp;rsquo;ve only included devices that are readily available unlocked, without carrier control over software updates. The Moto X Play (Snapdragon 615) and Galaxy S6 (Exynos 7420) included as exceptions based on their interesting SoCs. Windows phones excluded as Geekbench isn&amp;rsquo;t available.</description>

      <title>setting wpf control properties based on bound property attributes</title>

      <description>I was recently working on an MVVM project where various validation attributes were being set on the data model, and was looking for a solution to bind WPF editor control properties to these validation restrictions. (e.g. Setting TextBox.MaxLength based on StringLengthAttribute.)
Combining a couple of Stack Overflow posts:
 How to add a Blend Behavior in a Style Setter WPF TextBox MaxLength — Is there any way to bind this to the Data Validation Max Length on the bound field?</description>

      <description>If you want your .NET property validation attributes to match the exact minimum and maximum values for your SQL decimal and numeric data types, you can do so with a validation attribute that you can apply to properties with [SQLLimitedRangeAttribute](p, s), where p and s are the precision and scale for the data type.
namespace EliMarshal.ClassLibrary { using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; /// Validates to match SQL Server decimal data with given precision and scale /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt; public sealed class SQLLimitedRangeAttribute : ValidationAttribute { /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; /// Equal to the scale for the SQL data type.</description>

      <description>In an ideal world I&amp;rsquo;d simply eschew Adobe products and use Evince and/or PDF.js for my PDF requirements. Unfortunately I require Adobe&amp;rsquo;s COM Interop for some Windows developement projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved with. Although Acrobat Reader continues its march towards bloated, big-brother adware, Adobe does provide a customization wizard for enterprise deployments that allows much of cruft to be disabled, which can be used as follows:

      <title>HD favicons</title>

      <guid>https://www.elimarshal.com/post/hd-favicons/</guid>
      <description>Decided to add favicons and touch icons to the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve got no design skills, so used Jdenticon to generate icons based on my name. RealFaviconGenerator will automatically generate favicons with comprehensive browser and OS support, but I only really care about up to date browsers and operating systems, so I used their FAQ to piece together the requirements for that.
I used Jdenticon to generated large (3200x3200) icon. Then using GIMP, I autocropped edges and scaled to required various sizes as detailed below, each from fullsize and exported as PNG or ICO.</description>

      <description>2016-08: Updated to reflect currently available ad blockers.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a summary of the best available options.
Device Independent Use a hosts file on your linux-based router of choice to block ads across your home network. Not really recommended anymore due to lack of control on individual devices.
Android Use Firefox with uBlock Origin. Nearly as good as desktop browsing, except the uBlock UI isn&amp;rsquo;t really usable on mobile, so only the default easy mode blocking is practical.</description>

      <title>Apple Watch review</title>

      <description>Summary: It only works with iPhones, so it&amp;rsquo;s useless to me.
Note that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t only work with iOS devices, it&amp;rsquo;s specifically limited to the iPhone; compatibility is articifically limited from both iPads and iPods.
The latest (among several) revisions of either the iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini, and iPod Touch all meet every possible requirement for the Apple Watch (as established by the minimum supported iPhone 5), the only thing they lack compared to an iPhone are cellular connectivity.</description>

      <title>two years with the Surface RT</title>

      <guid>https://www.elimarshal.com/post/two-years-with-the-surface-rt/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now owned the original 64 GB Surface RT for just over two years. In that time I&amp;rsquo;ve probably averaged 20 minutes or so of use per day, including days with no usage, and days with 8+ hours of usage.
My general observations on the device, not intended to be a full review so long after release:
Wear Tablet: Impeccable condition still. The kickstand loosened a couple times, which I retightened with a very small Torx screwdriver.</description>

      <description>Google Maps used to have a nice feature where, when logged in to your Google account, you could add named destinations. Once they were saved, you could type the destination like &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; when looking for directions, and the address would populate automatically, like so:

This was lovely, but some time ago (mid-2013) Google disabled this feature unless you enable Web History to store all of your searches (among other things):</description>

      <title>goals vs dreams</title>

      <description>I recently made a relatively flippant comment to a friend (&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t set goals, I just excel at everything.&amp;rdquo;) and felt the need to elaborate.
There are two main points of contention in how I view goals. The first is purely a semantic issue; I view goals as a clearly achievable, likely set of circumstances achievable by following a certain set of actions. Buying two lottery tickets every week is a goal.</description>

      <title>IKEA standing desk</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been bouncing around the idea of a standing desk for health/comfort reasons for quite some time, but having a quality desk and chair already, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly motivated to do anything about it. Finally after moving to a location with an IKEA for the first time in my life, I hit up Google for ways to build a standing desk setup without any power tools.
Eventually I settled on using the IKEA Hackers: Galant Standing Desk post as a basis for my desk.</description>
